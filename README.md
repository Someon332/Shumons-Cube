Two seperately printed case parts (top and bottom) and the actual PCB. 
It's very basic but I can always swap out the case lol. The PCB is pretty basic too, just the switches and 4 neopixels, but it's more than enough for my purposes (hotkeys).

Not too complicated, had to use some vias because of all the criss-crossing connections.

This shows the top case, the PCB (middle blank rectangle), and the bottom, but spaced out so you can see how it's all layered.
